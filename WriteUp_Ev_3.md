# Evolution 3 - Write Up

### Retrospective

- Identify Bad design choices
- Did the design decisions effect the them and how?
- What would you have done differently

### Analysis

This current design is adeparture from a basic CRUD app, as multiple resources are now able to be reserved under single reservations, and we had to implement and elaborate approval system for reservations. At the core, the operations on the database remain the same, but now there are intermediate stages in between user making a reuest and the CRUD calls being made on the database. 
- Justify current design decisions.
- How will these decisions help in the future?
- Identify weaknesses and strengths?
- How would you fix the weaknesses in the future?


------------
- Grammar and writing.
