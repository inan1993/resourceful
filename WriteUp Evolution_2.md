# Evolution 2


### API
To implement a RESTful API the [nimble:restivus](https://github.com/kahmali/meteor-restivus) Meteor package was used. The package makes implementing CRUD endpoints for Mongo collections extremely easy. It comes with User authentication features for each request as well as the ability to limit access to certain endpoints based on Roles. It also allows for customization of all http requests. There are numerous other featuers that made this package stand out among others. 

This package was chosen because for the first evolution of the application, the team decided to use meteors *Autoform* package to handle submitting forms and storing them as well as updating them in the database. Autoform also used the *SimpleSchema* package that helped validating forms against a well defined schema. However with Autoform it is difficult to expose endpoints as APIs and so it couldnt be used to create the APIs that were needed. 

With Restivus however, creatin these endpoints are extremely easy. And although these endpoints run in parallel to enpoints we have in the actual app currently they are functionally the same since we are mostly just performing some basic CRUD operations on the items in the database, along with some authorization. In the future if the business logic changes and expands, we will have to think of a way where we can separate the business logic from the endpoints, so that they can be used by both hooks and there is no repeated code. This should be fairly easy as well.

For testing the APIs we used a web tool called POSTMAN. POSTMAN allows you to create custom HTTP requests with custom headers, body and authentication. You can even write custom tests for the responses. It is easy to use and circumvents the need to write a separate tool for testing.

### Oauth
In the previous evolution, user accounts where fully contained in the application. Evolution 2 required integration with Duke NetIDs to work with the website. We used Oauth2 authentification to integrate this. When a user wants to log in with their netID, they press the duke login button on the homepage, which sends a request to the Duke OAuth server to authenticate for our application. Then they user is redirected to an oauth endpoint on our website, where logic in the router is used to extract the access_token returned from Duke. The router then sends the token to the server to do an http get request to duke to retrieve the validated netid. This netid is returned to the client. Additionally, our use of OAuth presented an inherent problem with Meteor - Meteor is primarily designed to use either a social media login or its own login system.  Since Meteor's internal system requires a username and password, we needed to register an independent login handler to work with Duke's OAuth system.  The issue we are running into is how to treat that result as valid and integrate with the login package system we have in place. Unfortunately there is little documentation for how to create a personalized oauth login handler, and we will need to look closely at established handlers (login with facebook, for instance) to see how it is done and attempt to replicate that process.

### Permissions
Based on our past decision to use Autoform, which allows us to dynamically generate a form to update or insert any document into our Mongo collections, we created a Groups collection to hold the various groups. This raised an interesting problem - when checking if a user could do a certain action, would it be better to lookup his permissions for all the groups he was a part of, or to just add the permission to the user when the group was created?  We decided that to improve performance it would be best to just add the field to the user.  Since we did not want to have to store a list for a user of what reservations or resources he could see, as this would be much longer than the list he could not see, we chose to invert the permissions to have a list of reservations he could not see/reserve.  Right now, we have some shortcomings - editing an individual user is not possible, though in the next evolution we will expose only the "email" portion of our database so it will not be a security or performance risk to do this.  We also plan on implementing some sort of dynamic search that will let us sort through users, resources, or whatever it may be faster.  This also means me can avoid relying on the user to already know a user's email when changing permissions, for example.  Additionally, while our choice of AutoForm meant the actual inputting of the groups was very easy, it made it more difficult to do inserts into the user table - the user table is not created by autoform and is protected by default, which means that updates on it are difficult to make. Going forward, we will need to find an alternate solution so we can let users edit the user table while still performing the validation tasks that AutoForm is currently enabling us to do.
