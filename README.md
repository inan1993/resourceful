## Introduction
Resourceful is a web-based resource reservation system built on the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) platform. The premise of the application is that a company (Resourceful LLC) is in need of an internal resource management system for employees to checkout the resources they need to use.
Users of the system receive an account, search for resources they wish to reserve (server space, conference rooms, and more), reserve the resources (or be told the resource is occupied during their desired time), delete/edit their reservations after initially requesting them, and receive notifications of their upcoming reservations.
An admin can control all the users and reservations.
