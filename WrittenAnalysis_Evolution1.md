# Written Analysis for Evolution 1
## Resourceful LLC

As this is the first evolution of the project, all of the design decisions are focused on laying the initial foundation for the software. The large design choices we made were to make our application web-based and to use the Meteor framework. 

With the Meteor framework, a lot of the design questions were answered for us. The program is broken into client and server-side code, each written in Javascript and all the nitty-gritty work of connecting the two correctly is done under the hood by Meteor. The UI is a dashboard with a calendar view that can display reservations. Reservations, resources, and users are stored in three different collections. Keeping them separated allows us to easy change the core functionality or add another key component in future evolutions without too much untangling to do. 

Storage of all the collections (resources, users, reservations) is all with a MongoDB database (again Meteor does all the configurations for this under the hood). The benefit of using MongoDB is that adding fields to entries is easy -- it is schema-less and that one can index on any field of a document with MongoDB. We are certain than in future evolutions, we will need to store more/different types of information. Using MongoDB renders our data storage process extremely extensible. 

Various functioncal components of the application such as having user accounts, the login function, and the calendar are all modular pieces with a simple APIs to interface between one another. The core of these features are packages built-on/installable in Meteor, so all that we had to do as programmers was connect the html and call the built-in funcitons where appropriate. There is a significant amount of logic that we built on top of these components (controlling access to admin-only pages, creating new reservations properly, and so on). We chose to 

Our design is powerful because our framework is incredibly powerful and we kept our program modularized and simple. 

It's hard to find serious issues with our design since so far there have been simple, effective ways to code every single component that we need while mainting moduarity of features and thus extensibility. There are a few small drawbacks. For instance, some of the default behaviour in the Meteor packages that we used do not behave entirely as expected, and with just the API method at our disposal it can be difficult to find work arounds. One specific example of this was that in the login Meteor package, calling the createUser() function autmatically logs the new user in upon sucessful creation. However, since our admin is creating the users, we don't want that funcitonality. Learning how to alter this behaviour required research and extra work. However, overall the benefits of using the prebuilt Meteor package certainly outweigh the time that would be required to build say, and entire login feature from scratch (and it would be redundant since it has already been developed a thousand times over across the world of computer science).
